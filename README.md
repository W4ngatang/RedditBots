# RedditBots

My collection of Reddit bots.

AMASummarizer:

For r/iama, finds the questions that the OP answered and aggregates them in one post

Current: rate limited by Reddit on how often can post comments + reply, need to amass a lot of karma to overcome them

Known bugs:
- need to handle root level comments of OP (e.g. when signing off)
- need to handle ampersands, link text, other symbols

MusicDiscovery:

For r/listentothis, for a submission, searches Spotify, Youtube, Soundcloud, etc. for more music by the artist.
